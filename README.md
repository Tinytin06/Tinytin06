## Hi there 👋
I'm Austin Carter Luu. A Washingtonian who is in the Cybersecurity Master's major and completed a Computer Science Major, looking for internship/job opportunities in the tech field. I'm currently working on a homelab with a network-attached storage as the server. I currently code in Python, JavaScript, and Java, but have fundamentals for any C-based or Object oriented based language. I have an education in AI, Cloud Computing, SDLC, Agile practices, CyberSecurity, and lower-level coding, but am really interested in how new technologies like AI and Cloud Computing will affect Cybersecurity. Reach out via Email at Aluu0610@gmail.com

Classes I am currently taking for my Masters Degree:
Engineering malicious code using decompilers/Binary
Faculty Research Seminar
High Performance Computing
